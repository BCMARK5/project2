                <p>Curiousity is the keyword to this whole process. Find where you are curious. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>What sound is interesting?</li>
                        <li>What genre is interesting?</li>
                        <li>Who do you want to sound like??</li>
                        <li>What space can you imagine filling?</li>
                    </ul>
                    You need to ask all of these questions. Once you have, ask yourself what vehicle you need to get yourself there and watch the magic build itself. 
                    Getting lost in the "zone" is the key to creative mastery. Once you're in that flow state, building a project file with a multitude of plugins, channels, and compositions is second nature.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Channel Rack</h2>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>The channel rack is crucial for testing patterns and organizing your work. Organizing your work 
                    speeds up your work-flow and allows creativity to breathe without the pain of finding where you put a sample you pulled a week ago is located. 
                    Additionally, FL Studio has made several improvements to the channel rack which are worth exploring. I like to double click on a channel in the channel rack 
                    to play with its pitch and trim settings.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Mixer</h2>
                <figure>
                <img src="Mixer.png" width= "600" alt="FL Studio Mixer">
                <figcaption>FL Studio Mixer | <cite>by StationNineWorld</cite></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>You can't fit a whole room of people of different heights and sizes into the same picture without 
                    doing a bit of arranging. Additionally, you can't hear every sound in it's complete fullness at once unless you 
                    only have a few sounds on a track. You need to <strong>mix your track!</strong>. Mixing really determines if the magic in your track 
                    will be translated properly to your audience. With the loudness wars and competitive nature of music, your track needs to cut through the noise 
                    just like the individual instruments need to cut through others frequencies.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Piano Roll</h2>
                <figure>
                <img src="PianoRoll.png" width= "600" alt="FL Studio Piano Roll">
                <figcaption>Piano Roll | <cite>by StationNineWorld</cite></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The piano roll is where composers make their mark. Here you can automatically set chords, write melodies and chords piece by piece
                    and adjust the velocity of each note. I like to adjust the velocity of drum hits to imitate the variation of a drummer's hits. 
                    There is a lot of room to play with here, don't take my word for hearsay either. After you're done reading this, take everything you read here 
                    and throw it out the window. Then come back, and find out for yourself.

            <h2 class="section-title">The Playlist</h2>
                <figure>
                <img src="Playlist.png" width= "600" alt="FL Studio Playlist">
                <figcaption>Playlist | <cite>by StationNineWorld</cite></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The playlist is where it all comes to life. There's nothing better than sitting back, hitting play, and 
                    listening as your work comes to life. You can use the channel rack patterns, or just place sounds directly into 
                    the playlist. 
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="SampleLibrary.png" width= "600" alt="FL Studio SampleLibrary">
                    <figcaption>Playlist | <cite>by StationNineWorld</cite></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <p>Don't forget to have a solid sample library where you have your own sample packs as well. There's nothing
                    better than <em>reverse engineering</em> sounds to find out how another artist created that sound. These libraries
                    will serve as ample inspiration.
